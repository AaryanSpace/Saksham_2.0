# Saksham: Learning with Confidence

Saksham is an educational app designed to empower individuals with Dyscalculia and learning difficulties to master essential life skills.

I built this app specifically for my brother, to help him navigate the world of numbers without fear. Unlike standard learning apps, **Saksham focuses on real-world independence**—teaching users how to count, recognize Nepali & Indian currency *(currently Nepali currency is available, Indian currency coming soon)*, and manage grocery shopping in a fun, pressure-free environment.

With full voice support in English, Hindi, and Nepali, Saksham ensures that language is never a barrier to learning. It’s not just a game; it’s a tool for confidence.
