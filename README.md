# Saksham: Learning with Confidence

Saksham is an educational app designed to empower individuals with Dyscalculia and learning difficulties to master essential life skills.

I built this app specifically for my brother, to help him navigate the world of numbers without fear. Unlike standard learning apps, **Saksham focuses on real-world independence**—teaching users how to count, recognize Nepali & Indian currency *(currently Nepali currency is available, Indian currency coming soon)*, and manage grocery shopping in a fun, pressure-free environment.

With full voice support in English, Hindi, and Nepali, Saksham ensures that language is never a barrier to learning. It’s not just a game; it’s a tool for confidence.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Money Magic:** Practice identifying and counting Nepali currency notes.
* **Market Mission:** A simulated shopping experience to practice buying and paying.
* **Number Fun:** Interactive math and counting games (Math Ninja).
* **Multilingual Support:** Full voice-over guidance in English, Hindi, and Nepali.
